**티켓:** 0118 Log
**상태:** ✅ 성공


### 작업 요약
- - **World**: Near-future dystopia where all actions/emotions are recorded and measured
- - **Tone**: Detached, clinical, bureaucratic yet subtly unsettling
- - **Protagonist**: Compliant but aware, experiencing something the system cannot fully categorize
- - **Format**: System log style with official footer notes
- The log has been committed to git. Future entries will build on this foundation, maintaining continuity with the established world and evolving the subtle sense of wrongness in this dystopian reality.
